# Retro Hyprland

Retro Hyprland is a shader which mimics the look and feel of the old cathode tube screens. It has been designed to be eye-candy, customizable, and reasonably lightweight.

## Installation and Enabling the Shader

Just download the `retro.frag` file and put it somewhere desirable.

You can enable the shader using the following command:

```sh
hyprctl keyword decoration:screen_shader '~/.config/hypr/shaders/retro.frag'
```

To disable it, do this:

```sh
hyprctl keyword decoration:screen_shader ''
```
